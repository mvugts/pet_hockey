# pet_hockey
In this hobby project I learned some stuff about programming in R. and Python, using data from the hockey team that I coach.

The goal is to create an interactive dashboard with performance indicators for the team and individual players. Once it works, it would be nice to create something useful for competitive (senior) hockey players and coaches like myself.

Don't hesitate to help me learn...

The data includes:
- Exports of manual coding of in-game events, using a video analysis software package (NAC sport basic +): XML (semi-structured) or Excel (structured) files
- Data collected with a Google form to track and motivate individual off-season workouts
- 'Other data' such as results of physical performance tests

I know ... there are many more great things to do with competitative team sports dat: video, gps, heart rate, etc. 

It's a hobby, but who knows what's next...
