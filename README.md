# learning_R_Python_with_field_hockey_data
In this hobby project I learned some stuff about programming in R. and Python, using data from the hockey team that I coach.

The goal is to create an interactive online dashboard with performance indicators for the team and individual players. 
Ulitimately, it would be nice to build something useful for competitive (senior) hockey players and coaches like myself.

Don't hesitate to help me learn...

The data includes:
- Exports of manual coding of in-game events, using a video analysis software package (NAC sport basic +): XML (semi-structured) or Excel (structured) files
- Data collected with an online questionnaire to track and motivate individual off-season workouts
- 'Other data' such as results of physical performance tests

Hope to do some cool stuff in the future with video, gps, heart rate, etc.
